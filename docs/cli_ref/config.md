# Configuration

These configs automatically set command-line options,
so you don't have to pass a provide of options.
Just set a config and the app will automatically set the command-line options.

For example, let's say you want to download a manga with:

- Force HTTPS port
- No progress bar
- Using DNSOverHTTPS to cloudflare
- No manga cover
- No group name in each chapters
- And the chapters language must Indonesian
- And store it to `manga` directory

The command:

```shell
mangadex-dl "https://mangadex.org/title/..." --force-https --no-progress-bar --dns-over-https "cloudflare" --cover "none" --no-group-name --language "Indonesian" --path "manga"
```

It is wayyyy too longgggggg and you have to write these command-line options every time to download manga.
How to fix this ? **Config** is the only answer !

First, enable config first.

```shell
# `1` is alias for True and `0` is alias for False

# For Windows
set MANGADEXDL_CONFIG_ENABLED=1

# For Linux / Mac OS
export MANGADEXDL_CONFIG_ENABLED=1
```

```{note}
Keep in mind this is for current session console only. If you want to set it permanently, 
change the user environment variables.
```

Second, set the values for configs

```shell
# `1` is alias for True and `0` is alias for False
mangadex-dl "conf:force_https=1"
mangadex-dl "conf:no_progress_bar=1"
mangadex-dl "conf:dns_over_https=cloudflare"
mangadex-dl "conf:cover=none"
mangadex-dl "conf:no_group_name=1"
mangadex-dl "conf:language=Indonesian"
mangadex-dl "conf:path=manga"
```

After that you can download the manga without writing very-very long command-line options.

```shell
mangadex-dl "https://mangadex.org/title/..."
```

**But, I don't want type all those commands. I just want single command,
just type the file that I have every configs that I wanna change and it changed**.

Well, you can do it too. But, this time we're using `-pipe` option.

Let's say you have `config.txt`. And inside of that file is that every configs that you wanna change.

```shell
conf:force_https=1
conf:no_progress_bar=1
conf:dns_over_https=cloudflare
conf:cover=none
conf:no_group_name=1
conf:language=Indonesian
conf:path=manga
```

And then you execute these commands:

```shell
# For Windows
type config.txt | mangadex-dl -pipe

# For Linux / Mac OS
cat config.txt | mangadex-dl -pipe
```

Hooray your config is now changed!
