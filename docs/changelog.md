- Removed `--enable-legacy-sorting` option as it's deprecated since v1.1.0

### Notes: Unsafe feature removal

You may be wondering, why remove a feature that got added 2 months before ?

Okay that was my mistake,
because i was really naive to implement some restriction that makes user have a complicated process when downloading manga from MangaDex.
See [d3470ce](https://github.com/mansuf/mangadex-downloader/commit/d3470ce47e7475f604cdd8b30a12f249a2bbcb38),
but here's the thing, it's a downloader tool and it has nothing to do with content restrictions in a downloader tool.

### Improvements

- Whenever the app in resuming download state, it will verify all downloaded images. Causing the app to perform faster when resuming download. **NOTE:** in v1.0.2 and lower, the app will open connection to MangaDex CDN to check if image from MangaDex CDN is same size as the downloaded one, which cause slow performance.

(**NOTE:** to clarify, you still can search porn manga in MangaDex by login and enable it in settings)
