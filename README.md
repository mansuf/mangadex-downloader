## Supported formats <a id="supported-formats"></a>

[Read here](https://mangadex-dl.mansuf.link/en/latest/formats.html) for more info.

## Installation <a id="installation"></a>

What will you need:

- Python 3.8.x to 3.11.x with Pip (if you are in Windows, you can download bundled executable. [See this instructions how to install it](#installation-bundled-executable))

That's it.

### Python Package Index (PyPI) <a id="installation-pypi"></a>

Installing mangadex-downloader is easy, as long as you have requirements above.

```shell
# For Windows
py -3 -m pip install mangadex-downloader

# For Linux / Mac OS
python3 -m pip install mangadex-downloader
```

You can also install optional dependencies

- [py7zr](https://pypi.org/project/py7zr/) for cb7 support
- [orjson](https://pypi.org/project/orjson/) for maximum performance (fast JSON library)
- [lxml](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/) for EPUB support

Or you can install all optional dependencies

```shell
# For Windows
py -3 -m pip install mangadex-downloader[optional]

# For Mac OS / Linux
python3 -m pip install mangadex-downloader[optional]
```

There you go, easy ain't it ?.

### Bundled executable <a id="installation-bundled-executable"></a>

**NOTE:** This installation only apply to Windows.

Because this is bundled executable, Python are not required to install.

Steps:

- Download latest version here -> https://github.com/mansuf/mangadex-downloader/releases
- Extract it.
- That's it ! You have successfully install mangadex-downloader.
  [See this instructions to run mangadex-downloader](#usage-bundled-executable-version)

### Docker <a id="installation-docker"></a>

Available at:

- https://hub.docker.com/r/mansuf/mangadex-downloader
- https://gallery.ecr.aws/mansuf/mangadex-downloader

```sh
# Dockerhub
docker pull mansuf/mangadex-downloader

# AWS ECR (Alternative)
docker pull public.ecr.aws/mansuf/mangadex-downloader
```

If you want to get optional features such as `EPUB` support, `cb7` support, etc.
You can use tag ending with `-optional`

```sh
# Dockerhub
docker pull mansuf/mangadex-downloader:latest-optional
docker pull mansuf/mangadex-downloader:v2.10.3-optional

# AWS ECR (Alternative)
docker pull public.ecr.aws/mansuf/mangadex-downloader:latest-optional
docker pull public.ecr.aws/mansuf/mangadex-downloader:v2.10.3-optional
```

**NOTE**: If you're wondering why optional tags doesn't have arm/v6 platform support.
That's because some dependencies (most notably `orjson`) require rust compiler
and i give up installing rust compiler in arm/v6 platform, there is too much errors for me.

### Development version <a id="installation-development-version"></a>

**NOTE:** You must have git installed. If you don't have it, install it from here https://git-scm.com/.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mansuf/mangadex-downloader.git
cd mangadex-downloader
python setup.py install # or "pip install ."
